# Mazerama
Is a game that will take 2D picture of maze and craft a whole new 3D AR experience. It will be your goal to navigate the maze, tilting your phone to get the ball to the finish. After you have done so, the game will close and if you like to can just play again :)

## Known bugs
Depending on the phone device, sometimes the ball dissapears. To solve this hold your phone directly above the target image and restart the application.
